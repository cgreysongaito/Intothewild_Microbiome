Additionally, during HIV and SIV infection, IL-17- and IL-22-producing cells are lost, and this is associated with damage to epithelial barrier integrity, inflammation, and pathogenic effects (32_34, 46). Although we observed no correlations between Th17 and Th22 frequencies and any specific bacterial population, the alterations observed may have been induced by minor populations or combinations of populations not represented in the overall microbiome composition detected.
